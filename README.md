# Exemplar Stack

Exemplar is a component stack for contract-driven, observable, human-governed
automation in small-business operator workflows. Reeve currently contains
first implementations of some stack disciplines, but those disciplines are
stack components, not Reeve features.

The integration stance is proactive: safety, routing, anomaly, authority,
audit, and smoke controls are wired before a customer-visible failure proves
the need. Implementation can phase by maturity, but these controls are part of
the gold-standard operating environment.

For an infrastructure-team handoff that explains the operational invariants,
composition paths, failure semantics, and capability introduced by the tool
suite, read [docs/infrastructure-handoff.md](docs/infrastructure-handoff.md).
For the local `~/Code` inventory that separates core Exemplar tools from
supporting, adjacent, research, and non-tool repos, read
[docs/code-inventory.md](docs/code-inventory.md).

Cartographer scans existing systems and drafts Constrain/Pact/Ledger/Arbiter/
Baton/Sentinel artifacts before a component is fully onboarded.
```

## Production-Stability Disciplines

- Budget every hot-path external resource through aegis.
- Validate wire contracts through covenant before cross-component egress;
  TypeScript Zod contracts are canonical and JSON Schema export drift is a CI failure.
- Use Ledger for data obligations and Arbiter for access/trust/blast-radius
  findings derived from observed behavior.
- Emit component health through peer APIs rather than a shared health table.
- Correlate raw events into stories through Chronicler before feeding pattern
  consumers such as Vigil, Stigmergy, and Apprentice.
- Use Cartographer during adoption and CI compatibility checks to discover
  missing stack artifacts before runtime.
- Keep stack-wide and continuous smoke assertions in `~/Code/stack-smoke`.
- Keep Reeve-specific migrations to extracted libraries in Wave 3, after
  component ADRs and skeletons land.

## Current Status

- `aegis`, `covenant`, `vigil`, `scram`, and `witness` are standalone public
  repos with `v0.1.0` releases.
- `baton`, `ledger`, `arbiter`, `chronicler`, `stigmergy`, `cartographer`,
  `stack-smoke`, and this overview repo are part of the broader Exemplar
  tooling surface.
- `baton-stack` is deployed on Fly and participates in live stack-smoke via
  `/api/snapshot` and `/v1/about`.
- Reeve is the first production integration host. It is deployed to staging and
  production with smoke checks for liveness, readiness, audit-chain shape,
  stack mode, and registry population.
- The next phase is composition: migrate Reeve to consume the extracted
  libraries, make Scram dispatchers real, surface Vigil in the operator
  dashboard, keep continuous smoke running, and promote `stack-smoke` into a
  full multi-service scenario.
